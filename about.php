          <p>The institution has been located in the centre of the city and always affected by heavy pollution in terms of air pollution, noise pollution.To avoid all above said obstacles the institution has initiated this practice for several years. </p>
          <p>The Ultimate aim behind the green campus is to increase the oxygen level, decrease the noise pollution level  and to create a pleasant green environment for the stakeholders who are directly or indirectly associated with this century old institution.</p>
          <p>But the main challenge we are facing is that the Institution is committed to the environmental audit needs and will try to impart training which will be beneficial to staff and students.</p>
